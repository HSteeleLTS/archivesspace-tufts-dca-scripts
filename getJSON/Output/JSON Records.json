The Office of the President was the first, and for a time only, administrative office. Originally, the president performed virtually all administrative duties. Presidents usually were members of the faculty as well. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as administrative functions became more complex, the duties of the president were spread among other administrators.  With the professionalization of college and university administration in the mid-twentieth century, specialized administrative offices were created, and faculty no longer performed dual roles of educators and administrators.", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "publish": true}, {"subnotes": [{"content": "This collection is partially processed.", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "300ab748bbbfb4f12a1dc4a885a2c8ea", "publish": true, "label": "Processing status", "type": "processinfo"}, {"subnotes": [{"content": "2006.020, 2006.020; 2007.026 ", "publish": false, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "da057fb3454389baf5e2c2e5680062b2", "publish": false, "label": "Accessions", "type": "odd"}, {"rights_restriction": {"local_access_restriction_type": ["RestrictedSpecColl"]}, "subnotes": [{"content": "University records are closed for 20 years from the date of their creation.
